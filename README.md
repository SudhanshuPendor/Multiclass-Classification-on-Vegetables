## 📊 Classification Task

This notebook focuses on solving a supervised learning problem where the target variable consists of more than two classes. It includes:

- Label encoding
- Train-test split
- Training models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Confusion Matrix visualization

## 🏁 Getting Started
